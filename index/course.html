                <h3>INTERMEDIATE</h3>
                <P>The most basic interdisciplinary studies definition is that these programs allow students to choose their concentrations. You can effectively create your own major by choosing two areas of interest and combining them into one degree program that you’ll specialize in. For example, say you love psychology and art.</P>

                <h3>DEGREE</h3>
                <p>degree, also called academic degree, in education, any of several titles conferred by colleges and universities to indicate the completion of a course of study or the extent of academic achievement.

                <h3>POST GRADUATION</h3>
                <p>The term “postgraduate degree” covers everything from postgraduate diplomas to master's degrees to doctoral degrees. Essentially, any degree that requires an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree as an admissions prerequisite can be considered a postgraduate degree. You might choose to pursue a postgraduate degree for a variety of reasons, including to change career paths, specialize in a highly-technical field, or move into a career in research or education. </p>
